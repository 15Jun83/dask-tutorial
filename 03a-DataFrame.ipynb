    "The `dask.dataframe` module implements a blocked parallel `DataFrame` object that mimics a subset of the Pandas `DataFrame`. One dask `DataFrame` is comprised of several in-memory pandas `DataFrames` separated along the index. One operation on a dask `DataFrame` triggers many pandas operations on the constituent pandas `DataFrame`s in a way that is mindful of potential parallelism and memory constraints.\n",

    "\n",
    "Pandas is more mature and fully featured than `dask.dataframe`.  If your data fits in memory then you should use Pandas.  The `dask.dataframe` module gives you a limited `pandas` experience when you operate on datasets that don't fit comfortably in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "During this tutorial we provide a small dataset consisting of a few CSV files.  This dataset is 45MB on disk that expands to about 400MB in memory (the difference is caused by using `object` dtype for strings).  This dataset is small enough that you would normally use Pandas.\n",

    "    MemoryError:  ...\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Speed\n",
    "\n",
    "Dask.dataframe operations use `pandas` operations internally.  Generally they run at about the same speed except in the following two cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Dask introduces a bit of overhead, around 1ms per task.  This is usually negligible.\n",
    "2.  When Pandas releases the GIL (coming to `groupby` in the next version) `dask.dataframe` can call several pandas operations in parallel increasing speed somewhat proportional to the number of cores."
